# Data Scientist Portfolio

Welcome to my **Machine Learning & Data Science Portfolio**. This repository serves as a central hub for all my projects, categorized by type and technique.

Each project is hosted in its own repository, linked below, and showcases skills in data analysis, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and deployment.
